%In order to parameterize any three-dimensional surface like a closed boundary one, we need to convert its polygonal mesh into a disk topology surface. For quality of texturing or re-meshing that uses a parameterization technique, it is more effective if the distortion of two-dimensional manifold planar domain map is as small as possible. We introduce a fast way to create seams along with three-dimensional surface for square boundary of a two-dimensional planar domain map. This paper describes a faster and less error technique than the  existing seam cutting methods by simply observing the location of high distortion area in the planar domain. The distortion rate of our proposed method is low as the original one with less time consuming. Also we discuss to find the best corner points in the square planar domain that enable to delivery of the lowest stretch by avoiding boundary constraint if possible.

%Several tools from topology are useful for mesh processing. These tools often operate on the 1-skeleton of a surface, i.e., the graph of edges embedded in the surface. A common task is to find a collection of edges called a cut graph - cutting along these paths turns the surface into a shape which can be flattened into the plane. This kind of flattening is necessary for texture mapping, remeshing, etc. For instance, the video linked to above shows a cut graph (in yellow) on a two-handled torus, which gets flattened to a circular disk.	One way to find a cut graph is to find a set of loops, no two of which are homologous, which cut the surface into a disk when removed. Intuitively, two loops on a surface are homologous if one can be deformed into the other while always keeping it entirely on the surface. For a closed orientable surface with genus g (i.e., a torus with g handles), there are 2g classes of homologically independent loops. A homology basis consists of one loop from each class. Not every homology basis is a cut graph: some homology bases either disconnect the surface or cut it into a punctured sphere. However, a greedy homotopy basis (described below) will cut the surface into a disk.
\abstract{Topology is a property in surfaces that plays a major role in computer graphics. Processing or analysis between two surfaces generally require both of them to be same topology. There are many tools or applications that require disk topology surfaces as input such as parameterization or remeshing. Therefore, we need convert any surfaces to be same as disk. The common procedure is to define edges graph inside surface that be split into two edges and turns surface into topological disk. We call it as homotopy cutting. Problems become more difficult when dealing with high genus surfaces such as torus. Based on a novel method, we present an enhancement method to define cut graph in high-genus surface for homotopy cutting. By using geodesic properties of each edge, we can generate more suitable edges graph than original method while remains performance and stability as original method.}
