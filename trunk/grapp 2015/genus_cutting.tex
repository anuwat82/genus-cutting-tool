\abstract{Topology is a property in surfaces that plays a major role in computer graphics. Processing or analysis between two surfaces generally require both of them to be same topology. There are many tools or applications that require disk topology surfaces as input such as parameterization or remeshing. Therefore, we need convert any surfaces to be same as topological disk. The common procedure is to define edges graph inside surface that be split into two edges and turns surface into topological disk. We call it as homotopy cutting. Problems become more difficult when dealing with high genus surfaces such as torus. Based on a novel method, we present an enhancement method to define cut graph in high-genus surface for homotopy cutting. By using geodesic properties of each edge, we can generate equally or more suitable edges graph than original method while remains performance and stability as original method.}

\section{\uppercase{Introduction}}
\label{sec:introduction}

\noindent Geometry processing is an important research in 3D computer graphics field. Without efficient algorithms, it is very difficult to develop any kinds of advance application for end-users. Some of important applications in 3D computer graphics, such as texture mapping \cite{Bennis:1991:PSF:127719.122744}, normal mapping \cite{Cohen:1998:AS:280814.280832}, remeshing \cite{Hormann00quadrilateralremeshing} and parameterization \cite{Tutte:1963,Floater:1997:PSA:248299.248308} require specific topology of input mesh. There are many cases that topological disk surface is specified for further processing. With such requirement of topology in input mesh, it has impact on several researches in computer graphics and graph theory. There are many properties in each mesh such as closed/open, holes and genus.

When dealing with mesh that require disk topology input, there is different measure on each kinds of meshes. Open surface has same topology as disk already which can pass directly but may need to take care in case of containing holes. The problems arise when dealing with closed surface since it has different topology from disk. The process to cutting surface into the disk is required. In case of sphere topology, it does not require much processes; only short graph edge is necessary. However, there is some processes to ensure quality that require more graph edges in homotopy cutting. The problem becomes more complex and more interesting when dealing with high genus surfaces. 
   
This present paper solves homotopy cutting on high genus surfaces. Our approach is an enhancement of a novel method \cite{Gu:2002:GI:566654.566589} in homotopy cutting; cutting surface into disk. A benefit of this method is to able to handle any kinds of 2-manifold surfaces, regardless from topology specific. We presents an algorithms that create cut graph on the area where geodesic path came from difference directions in exact geodesic distance \cite{Mitchell:1987:DGP:33367.33372,Surazhsky:2005:FEA:1073204.1073228} (see example in figure \ref{fig:geodesic rocket arm}). With an few extra calculation,  we can define equally or more appropriate cut graph from original method while remains performance and stability.

\subsection{Notations}
Before we explains various algorithms about homotopy including ours, let us define basic notations. We represent 2-manifold triangular surface or mesh $\mathscr{M}:=(V,F)$ where $V:=\{ v_{i}\in \mathbb{R}^3 : i = 1, ... , n_v\}$ is a set of $n_v$ vertices and $F:=\{ f_{i}(a,b,c) : a,b,c = 1, ... , n_v : a \neq b \neq c\}$ is a set of $n_f$ faces information as index of vertices. Let define $E:=\{ e_{i}(a,b) : a,b = 1, ... , n_v : a \neq b\}$ as a set of $n_e$ edges information that be found in surface $\mathscr{M}$. Mesh has genus $g$ topology. 


\section{\uppercase{Related Works}}
\label{sec:related works}
\noindent From previous researches in topological converting topic in the past few years, there was a novel study the problem of cutting a topological surface into the disk efficiently by \cite{Erickson:2002:OCS:513400.513430}. They have proposed a cutting method which has some elegant theoretical guarantees but is complex to implement. It finds the shortest loop path connecting a vertex to the vertex itself by using a front propagation technique, and then tests to see if the considering loop path reduces the surface genus or simply cut the surface into two pieces. It has topologically-sufficient cut as $2g$ loops. The generation of minimal length cuts that convert a high genus surface into a topological disk is a NP-hard problem. The method is a brute force approach which consumes a lot of time. it has approximation of the shortest cut graph in $O(g^2 n \log n)$ where $n$ donates complexity of the surface. In more study from \cite{Erickson:2005:GOH:1070432.1070581}, they studied about greedy homotopy basis and improvement speed in $O(n \log n)$
by using a straightforward application of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm \cite{Dijkstra59anote}. 

One of important in efficiency is to compute non-trivial cycles on orientable surfaces. Non-trivial cycles mean non-contractible and non-separating cycles which guarantees cutting topological surface into disk. Recently, \cite{Kutz:2006:CSN:1137856.1137919} presents an algorithm that computes a shortest non-trivial cycles on orientable combinatorial surface of bounded genus in  $O(n \log n)$. The algorithm is based on universal-cover constructions to find short cycles.

There are studies that trying to define cut graph by properties of surfaces. Study from \cite{Patane:2007:FCB:1224804.1224947} presents an algorithm that build up the cut graph on the iso-contours from Reeb graph which codes in a combinatorial structure the topology of a given surface $\mathscr{M}$ and connect loops together. Another study from \cite{Jin:2013:CSH:2396897.2396971}, presents algorithm to compute the shortest homotopic loop with negative Euler characteristic based on the surface hyperbolic uniformization metric. They also demonstrate two applications: constructing extremal quasi-conformal mappings between same topology surfaces, and detecting homotopy between two paths or cycles on a surface. 

There is a iterative method called "geometry images" by \cite{Gu:2002:GI:566654.566589}. This paper presents a remeshing approach using square surface parameterization to create  using mapping between disk topology irregular surface $\mathscr{M}$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ domain and square planar in $\mathbb{R}^2$ domain and sample positions to get a regular positions. To get low error on remeshing, they present how to create cut graph from any kinds of surface $\mathscr{M}$ regardless from pre-analysis such as topology and boundary edges.

Since our approach is based on geometry images, we explain how it creates cut graph for homotopy cutting on irregular surface $\mathscr{M}$ with genus $g$ property in section \ref{sec:previous algorithm}.
